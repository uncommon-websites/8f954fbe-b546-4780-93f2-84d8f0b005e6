    "prompt": "An elementary-aged child sitting at a tidy home desk, deeply focused on their studies. The room has warm, natural lighting, soft textures, and cozy decor such as a small plant, bookshelves, and art supplies. The child is using traditional school supplies like pencils, notebooks, and paper. The background shows a lived-in, welcoming home environment, with gentle color tones and personal touches such as family photos or a favorite toy nearby. Create subtle variations in the child's appearance, desk arrangement, and room decor to ensure each image feels unique while maintaining a consistent, inviting, and studious atmosphere.",
